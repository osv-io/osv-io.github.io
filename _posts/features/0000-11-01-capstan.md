title: Rapid VM build and deploy
---

OS<sup>v</sup> gives you low overhead and rapid turnaround, like containers, but with the deployment flexiblity you only get from true virtualization.  With the Capstan build tool, you can build and run with one command, but create a complete virtual machine that will run on your existing cloud environment. Creating a VM image adds only 6-7MB of overhead, three seconds of build time, and a few lines of configuration.  <a href="/capstan/">Learn more about Capstan.</a>
